# Hough-Transform
The circle Hough Transform is a feature extraction technique for detecting circles. It is a specialization of Hough Transform. The purpose of the technique is to find circles in imperfect image inputs. The circle candidates are produced by “voting” in the Hough parameter space and then select the local maxima in the accumulator array.
